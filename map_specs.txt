GtkRadiant + q3map2

For quake 3 BSPs: (may be incomplete, please update)

*1 engine unit = 32 quake 3 bsp units (1/32 scale)
*coordinates: engine X = quake -Y, engine Y = quake Z and engine Z = quake -X

TODO: put entity properties, default values and how to use them here, including when use() gets called for each entity type :)
(remembering that zeros will revert to default values)

TODO: explain about shaders and how to use them, including surfaceflags

In the 3D window, shift + click and drag will select visible brushes at the mouse cursor
Sometimes it is better to "resize" a brush to the new position instead of moving it there, to keep texture alignment
TODO: tutorials about map and model creation

TODO: for q3map2, all keys/values for brushes/entities and command line parameters

Detail brushes are very important, in GtkRadiant, use CTRL+M to make
a brush detail and use CTRL+D to filter detail brushes from view.
(TODO: this will simplify the vis tree, but the physics tree should
also be simplified by allowing the detail brushes being replaced
by a simpler collision mesh in the physics side)
