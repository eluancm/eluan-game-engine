Blender + IQM exporter
QUICK NOTES FOR MYSELF BECAUSE I'M NOT AN ARTIST

TODO: explain more details


In blender, 1 unit is 1 meter
In blender, Z is up, so these are the views with the NUMPAD numbers:
7: BACK LOOKING TO FRONT, UP IS UP
CTR+7: FRONT LOOKING TO BACK, UPSIDE DOWN
1: BOTTOM LOOKING TO TOP, RIGHT IS RIGHT
CTRL+1: TOP LOOKING TO DOWN, RIGHT IS LEFT
3: RIGHT LOOKING TO LEFT, UP IS BACK
CRTL+3: LEFT LOOKING TO RIGHT, UP IS BACK


TODO: Currently 60FPS, will we make it arbitrary? Good thing to do.

To make animations, Use the Gingerbread Man tutorial (saved in
/RedundantBackup/Linux/Programas/blender_2012/) then create new
animations for the same model by going into the "Dope Sheet" view
then selecting the "Action Editor" while in "Pose Mode" in the
"3D View", create a new animation then delete all the keyframes
from the preview to start fresh in this animation, but it's
recommended to copy the first frame of the previous animation, to
have them consistent. When exporting the IQM, select the mesh +
armature in object mode then, in the IQM exporter window, type the
animation names separated by ',' and with the optional parameters
defined in the IQM devkit README.txt. I don't know if this option
exists only on later versions, but selecting only "image" in
"Materials" when exporting will be OK and easier to map for simple
models. Complex ones will probably need material+image-ext.

There is a bug (don't know if in the IQM exporter or Blender) with
negative scales in objects. To work around it, just press Ctrl+A
(or go to object->apply) and apply the scale. If the bones are
flipped because of this, just go into the pose editor and apply a
negative scale in the affected bones. A good tip is to always
manipulate the bones by translating its endpoints, not by rotating
or scaling.

At least once the "Make quads into triangles" option made my mesh
ugly! Disabling bone envelopes in the Armature modifier of the
mesh can prevent a few weird issues with poses. Preserve volume
sometimes can be good too. (Is "dual quaternion" animation needed
in the engine for preserve volume to work in-game?)

Another VERY IMPORTANT THING: in the armature object properties, go
down to "Relation Extras" and set Tracking Axes to -Z Axis and Y Up
Axis. Somehow this fixed the skeleton animation AFTER exporting.
In blender it always worked! For Quake this wasn't necessary
because the coordinate systems are the same.

The IQM devkit README.TXT has useful information in overrinding
start frame, end frame, frames per second and setting the loop
flag while exporting the model from blender.

VERY IMPORTANT: Be sure to click the "F" in the Action Editor near
the action name, it's tooltip is "Save this datablock even if it
has no users". Otherwise blender will DELETE the animation after
exiting the program. Also the animation start and end become shared
when Blender is closed? So animation duration should be set in the
export script too, just like the loop flag

Aparently bounding boxes are only exported if we have frames, which
means to have 1 base animation of 1 frame and 1 armature/bone even
for static objects. (For some reason 2 frames are generated when
doing this, probably bacause no interval was specified when exporting
the animation, so it took all frames, starting from zero, and blender
sets the first keyframe to frame 1, thus 2 frames are generated.)

Selecting stuff with the Outliner view makes sure that everything
needed for the export is selected. Or maybe this aws the cause of
that hdf->num_poses != iqm->num_joints (or something like that) error
and I should use the "A" key to select everything before export?

Also, vertices not attached to any vertex group/bone weren't showing
up at all!

ANIMATION_BASE_FRAME should have all bones in resting position.

For mirroring skeletons, it's best to go into pose mode and press N
for the properties tab, then scale the root bone by -1 in the
desired axis there. TODO: will also have to rotate to mirror the
rotation. Also good to do into Edit Mode, press s then edit the scale.

Duplicating inside meshes: select parts of the mesh,
Mesh->Add Duplicate, then do scales and rotations.
(usually mirror x global)
Then select the applicable bones, Armature->Duplicate then do the
scales and rotations. (usually mirror x global)
Renomear os bones (geralmente com prefixo, pra ficarem juntos na
ordenação) e, como os vértices estão nos vertex groups dos bones
anteriores, fica fácil: ir no vertex group, select, desselecionar
os antigos, remove, criar vertex group pro novo, assign.

If subdividing and merging faces a lot, these situations cause problems:
.________.
|        |
|        |
.__.__.__.
|        |
|        |
.________.
Delete/merge these extra vertices at the middle!!! They cause lots
of problems, including with uv-unwrapping even properly seamed models

In the default blender screen, some tabs of the properties window may
be hidden, just make it bigger os use the mouse scroll wheel in the
tabs.

Animation Slots: for the engine, a file with the same name of the
model but with _jointmasks.txt at the end (like
test.iqm_jointmasks.txt for test.iqm) will define joint masks, they
serve to make some animations only transform some bones, depending
on the slot the animation is assigned to. Each line in the file
should be of the form "JointName AnimationSlotName" as in this
example:
--EXAMPLE START
LeftArm Arms
RightArm Arms
LeftHand Arms
RightHand Arms

LeftLeg Legs
RightLeg Legs
LeftFoot Legs
RightFoot Legs

Pelvis Pelvis

Torso Torso

Torso AllJoints
Pelvis AllJoints
LeftArm AllJoints
RightArm AllJoints
Head AllJoints
LeftLeg AllJoints
RightLeg AllJoints
LeftHand AllJoints
RightHand AllJoints
Hat AllJoints
LeftFoot AllJoints
RightFoot AllJoints
--EXAMPLE END
The base frame will only affect the model if it is part of the
animation (usually the Base animation) that has been assigned to the
animation slot with index 0 (check the engine source for this).
This is useful for disabling some animation slots and at the same
time permits using the base frame in models without animation.

Tags: for the engine, a file with the same name of the
model but with _tags.txt at the end (like test.iqm_tags.txt for
test.iqm) will define model tags, they serve tack possible attachment
locations in the model. Each line in the file
should be of the form "TagName TagPosX TagPosY TagPosZ JointName" as
in this example:
--EXAMPLE START
RightHand 0.875 0.268 0 RightHand
LeftHand -0.875 0.268 0 LeftHand
--EXAMPLE END
The tag position defined in the file should be the position in the
base/rest pose. It will be transformed by the specified joint when
animating an the final local or global position will be available to
the game code. By pressing N in the 3D view, a bar appears in which
the 3D cursor position can be viewed/etc (use the mouse wheel scroll
if necessary to view the hidden elements of the bar)

You can do: one skeleton/armature (to make global rotations easy) but
with various meshes parented by it (to separate stuff and reuse them
more easily)

If a bone named "TorsoPitchJoint" is present, the models pitch will
be applied to it before rendering and the model will be rendered with
zero pitch. Data from animation slot 0 will be taken for modifying
"TorsoPitchJoint" with the pitch. (TODO: this may and will change)

Model sounds: a file named sounds/$modelname$_sounds.txt will define
model-specific sounds in the "soundslot soundname" format. Example:
--EXAMPLE START
0 sounds/fire.wav
1 sounds/fire_emptyclip.wav
2 sounds/pain.wav
3 sounds/die.wav
--EXAMPLE END

Interesting side effect that I didn't notice: model textures with
alpha channel will render with alpha blending in the engine. (It also
auto-sorts by depth when necessary.)

In blender 2.77, with a model exported from makehuman, I was only
able to start animating after:
-Going to pose mode in the 3d view, to action editor in the dope sheet
view
-Selecting all bones, then going to pose->animation->change keying set
and selecting "whole character"
-if no keyframes are shown in the dope sheet, select all bones and
insert a new keyframe WITH THE MOUSE IN THE 3D WINDOW
-the you can start setting the frame vertical line in the dope sheet,
posing and pressing I with the mouse IN THE DOPE SHEET to create
keyframes
-remember that keyframes can be selected by right-clicking in the small
diamong or by pressing the "A" key to select/deselect all. (and copied
and pasted with ctrl+c and ctrl+v)

In the base pose, the model's distance from origin to the feet should
be considered as the location of the "ground" plane.

After importing into blender, select model in the outliner view
(usually top-right in the default blender window), press N in the 3D
view and set the X, Y, Z rotations to 90, 0, 180 to make the model
correspond to the coordinates in the engine. After that, press Ctrl+A
to apply the transform and select Rotation. Be sure to do the entire
process in Object Mode.

Ater all this, I also could remove the mesh modelname:Body (high
poly version). This Will make the triangle count better. Also, the
hair mesh still has lots of triangles. To fix that, select the hair
mesh, go to edit mode, select all vertices, press X and select limited
dissolve. Play with the parameters a little to make it look good from
all directions and with a lower number of faces (hit F6 if you don't
se the parameters in any bar). Then press CTRL+T to triangulate it
(mess with the parameters again, if needed). You could also try other
methods to deal with this, like the decimate modifier.
